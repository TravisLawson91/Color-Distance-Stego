Purpose:
 	The purpose of this program is to hide a payload in a bitmap
 	image, and extract the payload at a later time.
 	
 	We based our project on the paper written by Dr. Jiri Fridrich,
 	    A New Steganographic Method for Palette-Based Images

 	The program will take a 256 color bitmap and hide a payload 
 	based on the closest color of the current pixel color. When
 	we find the closest color, a we calculate the parity of the 
 	RBG values from the palette entry referenced by the pixel.
 	If the parity matches, we update the pixel index to reference
 	the new palette entry. If the parity of the current closest color
 	does not match our message bit, we check to see if the next 
 	closest color will. 
 	
 	Best result is the image is a error-difused bitmap
 
Commands:
	To hide:
		./bmp -hide [cover image] [payload]
	To extract:
		./bmp -extract outfile.bmp

Compile as 
	gcc -m32 -g -o bmp bitmap.c setLinkedListImp.c -lm

Notes:
	'outfile.bmp' is the name of the stego-image produced when hiding.
	'recovered' is the file name of the recovered payload.
